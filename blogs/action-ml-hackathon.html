                <p>
                  Action.ML was an ML hackathon hosted by FOX in addition to the ASU Luminosity lab, where the target was to develop deep learning models that could detect various aspects of a basketball game. We were asked to come up with novel models which could analyse streaming video in real-time to detect sequences such as attempting a three-pointer, crossing the half-way line, replay, etc. To make the task simpler, we were provided a dataset for each of the target sequences along with the image it correspond to to train the ML model. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  My favourite aspect of this hackathon was the opportunity to develop deep learning models with a specific goal in mind, in addition to using AWS Sagemaker to train and deploy these models. Even though I extensively use AWS, Sagemaker is a service I stay away from owing to it's relatively higher cost. This was a good opportunity to explore Sagemaker and use it fully. 
                </p> 
                <h3>What I liked about Sagemaker:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Use of Jupyter notebooks by default to build models. This made testing on the fly easier and allowed thorough debugging.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Jupyter was stacked with almost all typical environments for building ML models. The Tensorflow environment was available to get started with Keras (which we ended up using), and there were a multitude of options tailor-fit for many use-cases.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What I didn't like about Sagemaker:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The Sagemaker instance was regularly getting overwhelmed especially when running multiple jobs. Granted, using a larger instance could have fixed it (at a greater cost), but the inability to even access the server to force stop jobs was a downer. 
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In the end, our team (credits to my teammates) built a multi-layer CNN model with decent accuracy for train, test and validation. My key takeaways was on building complex ML models in AWS, training and testing them, and in the end save and deploy that model as an endpoint so new data can be quickly predicted.
